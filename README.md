# Japan Quiz

This is an app to help you learn the different types of writing systems in Japanese. 
It uses flash cards to help memorize the different symbols. 

So far I've implemented Katakana and Hiragana as plists and tracking score and highscore. I still need to create the plist for the Kanji.
I've also added a multiple choice section, where you're currently only being tested in Hiragana with a timer.

## TODO
-Plist for Kanji 
-Test for both Hiragana and Katakana 
-Test for Kanji based on stroke order.
-Next button for when you got the correct answer.
